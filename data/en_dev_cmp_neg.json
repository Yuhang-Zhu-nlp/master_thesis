be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents.", "Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance.", "For some goods, geography affects specialization.", "This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery.", "In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better.", "A similar pattern often operates within businesses.", "Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines.", "For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average.", "The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity.", "Hi
